# Booking System (MVP)

A Django-based (for the moment) booking system for managing appointments. The system is modular, allowing users to define their own services and workflows without altering the core structure.

---

## The App

### Overview
The Booking System enables:
- **Clients**: Book one or multiple services, view pricing, and manage their bookings via a unique link.
- **Providers**: Add and manage services, set availability slots, and oversee client bookings.

---

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FastAce/booking-system.git
cd booking-system
```

### Create a virtual environment (optional)
#### Create the environment:
```bash
python -m venv env
```

#### Activate it:
